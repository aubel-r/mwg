I, as a developer, build in analytics in my Android applications to be able to improve them, to give the user the best possible experience. This samples anonymous non-personal data that simply allows me to find out what users do and do not like. I fully respect the user’s privacy and never collects information that could be directly linked to the user. I also display advertisements to fund the creation of my applications. This is all governed by the following privacy policy:

Unless explicitly given the opportunity to accept this policy inside an app, please note that by using or otherwise accessing any of my mobile applications, you are agreeing to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use or otherwise access my applications.

### Anonymous Data

I may collect and use anonymous data, via Google Analytics. I cannot identify you from this data. Such data is pooled to give me general statistics on my audience and usage of my apps.

For example, Google Analytics automatically samples a user’s country and city, chosen device language, device model and make, screen resolution, app version being used, operating system version, mobile phone network. This pooled data provides statistics that can help me determine, for example, where my apps are being most commonly used, and on which devices. This can help me determine how to update my apps going forward.

Google Analytics also automatically collects data including app sessions numbers, session lengths, screen visits, flow from screen to screen, and app acquisition data (where a user came from to install an app). Alongside data that is automatically collected by Google Analytics, I also collect my own anonymous data on my app usage through Google Analytics. This includes game settings chosen, game results and other general UI events. Taken together, this data allows me to improve my apps in many ways. For example, if a high proportion of users can’t beat Droid 4 in My Word Game, I need to make it easier.

None of this collected data can be linked to any individual, and it is pooled to provide me with general usage and audience statistics. I am the only one to use the collected anonymous data.

Ad networks who provides adverts to my mobile applications may access your unique device identifier and use this to tailor ads to you. Some apps may request a location permission. In this case, your location is also anonymous and is only used by Ad networks to help tailor ads relevant to your location. Privacy Policy links for the networks I use are below.

### Third Party Terms and Conditions

Please note that certain third parties, including but not limited to application stores, may be needed in order for you to access my mobile applications. These third parties have their own privacy policies which I cannot control. You agree that I not liable for their use of your personal information.

### Links to Third Party Sites or Games

My mobile applications are supported by advertisements, which provide access to third party sites or apps.

Please be aware that, if you use any of these links you will leave my app and the page you go to will not be governed by my privacy policy. I cannot be responsible for the privacy of any information you provide whilst outside of my app.

### Updates to this Policy

I may revise my privacy policy from time to time. When I do, those changes will be reflected here (as accessed via my app pages on the relevant application store). Any significant change I make to data usage will be drawn to your attention via my apps. I encourage you to review this privacy policy from time to time. Your continued use of my applications will signify your acceptance of the changes to this privacy policy.

### Ad Networks & Analytics Policies

Advertising in my apps is provided by Google Ads network. Analytics is provided by Google Analytics. I choose to only provide ad networks with a minimal set of application permissions required for these ads to function. These analytics and ad networks may use data and cookies to help determine which ads to show you. Their privacy policies can be found at this address: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/.

Please be aware that, any information provided as a result of your interaction with these ads will not be governed by my own privacy policy. Ads may redirect you away from my app, and my privacy policy will no longer apply outside of my app. I cannot be responsible for the privacy of any information you provide whilst outside of my app, or any information provided to any of these third parties.
